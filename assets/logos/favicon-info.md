# Favicon Setup

## Current Status
- Your main logo (`company-logo.jpg`) is now active in the application
- Header and login page will display your logo
- Browser tab currently uses sample favicon

## To Add Your Logo as Favicon

### Option 1: Convert JPG to Favicon
1. Use an online converter (like favicon.io) to convert your `company-logo.jpg` to favicon.ico
2. Save the converted file as `favicon.ico` in this folder
3. The HTML is already set up to use it

### Option 2: Use Online Favicon Generator
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
2. Upload your `company-logo.jpg`
3. Download the generated favicon files
4. Place them in this folder:
   - `favicon.ico`
   - `favicon-32x32.png`
   - `favicon-16x16.png`
   - `apple-touch-icon.png`

### Option 3: Keep Current Setup
- Your logo displays perfectly in the header and login page
- Browser tab uses a simple truck icon
- This is perfectly functional

## Logo Display Locations
✅ **Header** - Shows your logo (40px height)
✅ **Login Page** - Shows your logo (60px height)
⚠️ **Browser Tab** - Uses sample favicon (can be updated)

Your logo integration is complete and working!
